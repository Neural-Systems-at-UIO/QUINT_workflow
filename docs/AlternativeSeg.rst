**Alternative tools**
-----------------------

Any image analysis software may be used to generate the segmentations as long as they meet the requirements of the *Nutil* software listed `here <https://nutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/QuantifierInput.html#preparing-the-segmentations>`_.  

.. tip::

    `QuPath: <https://qupath.github.io/>`_ is an alternative that can be used to generate the segmentations. In some cases QuPath may perform better than ilastik. See `this iprotocol <https://www.protocols.io/view/quint-workflow-for-fluorescence-4r3l22y6jl1y/v2>`_ for how to use QuPath for the QUINT workflow. 

    `FIJI: <https://imagej.net/software/fiji/>`_ is also useful for generating segmentations.
