*QCAlign* was developed to support the use of the QUINT workflow for high-throughput studies. It is a quality control tool that provides information about:

1. The quality of the section images used as input to the QUINT workflow. It enables detection of regions that are affected by tissue damage, labelling defects, artifacts, or errors in image acquisition.

2. The quality of the atlas-registration performed in the QUINT workflow.

In addition, *QCAlign* supports exploration of the reference atlas hierarchy, and the creation of a customized level to use for the investigation.
