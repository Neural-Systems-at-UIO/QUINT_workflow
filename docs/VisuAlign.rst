*VisuAlign* is a tool that allows in-plane refinement of the *QuickNII* registration using non-linear methods. 

* It is a manual process that involves placing anchor points on that atlas overlay which are then dragged to their correct position on the underlying section. 
* This step is optional, but can be used to improve the registration by adjusting for distortions as well as anatomical differences between brains.
* The results from *VisuAlign* are exported in machine-readable formats such as JSON, XML and FLAT files that are directly compatible with Nutil as long as the file naming convention has been followed.
