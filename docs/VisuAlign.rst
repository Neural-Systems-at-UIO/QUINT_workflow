* VisuAlign allows in-plane refinement of the *QuickNII* registration using non-linear methods. 
* This is a manual process using drop and drag of markers placed on the image. 
* This step is optional, but can be used to improve the registration by adjusting for distortions as well as anatomical differences between brains.
* The results from *VisuAlign* are exported in machine-readable formats such as JSON, XML and FLAT files that are directly compatible with Nutil as long as the file naming convention is respected.
