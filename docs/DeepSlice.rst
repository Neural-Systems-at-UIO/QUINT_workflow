**DeepSlice**

.. note::
  Find DeepSlice `here <https://www.deepslice.com.au>`_. 

* *DeepSlice* performes automated linear registration to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas CCF version using deep convolutional neural networks. There is also a beta-version for the Waxholm atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat. 
* At present *DeepSlice* only works for adult mouse brain sections cut in the coronal plane, although future versions will be compatible with sagittal and horizontal sections. 
* It can be used to automate and speed up steps 1 and 2 of the QuickNII registration process for coronal mouse brain sections.
* *DeepSlice* generates an XML or JSON file that can be opened with the *QuickNII* software to validate the registration. Nonlinear refinements can be applied with *VisuAlign*.
* It is recommended to inspect the outputs in *QuickNII* and make small adjustments to the position.
